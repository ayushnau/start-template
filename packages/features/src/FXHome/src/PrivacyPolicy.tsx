							email address, mobile number), date of birth or other details of
							that nature, when you sign up on the Site/App.

						When you create a WiredUp account, you can come up with a username

						address and/or phone number). To access features of the application,
						you will need to verify your account or add other information (like
						a verified phone number) to your account.

						If you buy any paid services through WiredUp, you may need to submit
						a valid payment method and associated billing information, including
						your full name and billing address. Our payment processors, like
						Stripe and RazorPay, receive and process your payment information.
						Depending on the processor, we may also receive and store certain

							3. If any of your contacts aren’t yet using WiredUp, then they can
							be asked to Join by invitation from you. We protect their privacy
							by managing the phone number in a way that is designed to prevent
							those contacts from being identified by WiredUp.
						</p>

							4. You can control the contact syncing feature from your
							AddressBook. If you choose not to use Contact sync you can still
							communicate with people who have WiredUp but certain
